Challenge 7
Set the total to 0 to start with. While the total is 50 or less, ask the user to input a number. Add that number to the total and
print the message

“The total is… [total]”.

Stop the loop when the total is 50 or over 50.








# Initialize the total to 0
total = 0

# Print the initial message
print("Let's add your numbers")

# Start the loop
while total <= 50:
    # Ask the user to input a number
    number = float(input("Add a number: "))

    # Add the number to the total
    total += number

    # Check if the total has reached or exceeded 50
    if total >= 50:
        print(f"The total is {total}")
        break

    # Print the message with the current total
    print(f"The total is {total}")
